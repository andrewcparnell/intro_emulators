## Introduction

- We now have a shiny and very fast emulator for our simulator

- But how do we know whether it works well?

- In this section we will go through some simple plots that work in both low and high dimensional problems

- We will then discuss some performance measures that enable us to judge whether the emulator is fitting well or not

It is helpful for this section to revise the use of `ggplot2`; see the [Rfternoon](https://andrewcparnell.github.io/Rfternoon/) course for a revision class


## Reminder: Navier-Stokes example

Recall our 2D Navier-Stokes example with 3 inputs and 1 output:

```{r, out.width="40%", echo = FALSE, fig.show = 'hold'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("NS_1.png", "NS_2.png"))
```

## Plotting the output

- One way of creating a neat plot is to fix all the variables but one or two
- We can then produce a plot of the remaining variable(s) changing across its range of values according to the emulator
- Suppose for example that we were just interested in the variable `kinematicViscosity`, we could fix the others at chosen values (e.g. 0.5) and then predict across the chosen variable
- We could extend this to look at two dimensions whilst holding the other fixed
- With further plotting magic we could add slider bars or an animation to look at the effect of changing the input values

## A 1D marginal plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
emulator <- readRDS(file = "../simulator/elbowFlow2d/emulator_run.rds")
x1_new <- 0.5
x2_new <- 0.5
x3_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
X_new <- matrix(NA, nrow = 100, ncol = 3)
X_new[, 1] <- x1_new
X_new[, 2] <- x2_new
X_new[, 3] <- x3_new

# Now create predictions everywhere
pred <- predict(emulator, X_new)

# Create a new data frame for plotting
df_new <- data.frame(
  largeInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 1],
  smallInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 2],
  kinematicViscosity = X_new[, 3] * (1e-5 - 1e-3) + 1e-3,
  yhat = pred$Y_hat
)
ggplot(df_new, aes(x = kinematicViscosity, y = yhat)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Large inlet and Small inlet velocities fixed at 0.5")
```

## A 2D marginal plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Next try varying two parameters and fixing the other
x1_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
x3_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
x_new <- expand.grid(x1_new, x3_new)
# Now vary temperature left across this field
X_new <- matrix(NA,
  nrow = nrow(x_new),
  ncol = 3
)
# Replace the first column with the varying variable
X_new[, 1] <- x_new[, 1]
X_new[, 2] <- 0.5
X_new[, 3] <- x_new[, 2]

# Now create predictions everywhere
pred <- predict(emulator, X_new)

# Create a new data frame for plotting
df_new <- data.frame(
  largeInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 1],
  smallInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 2],
  kinematicViscosity = X_new[, 3] * (1e-5 - 1e-3) + 1e-3,
  yhat = pred$Y_hat
)

ggplot(df_new, aes(x = largeInletVelocityMagnitude, y = kinematicViscosity, z = yhat)) +
  geom_contour_filled() +
  labs(fill = "Velocity") +
  ggtitle("Small inlet velocity fixed at 0.5")
```

## Further plots

- These marginal plots give us some idea as to the behaviour of a subset of the variables when others are fixed

- But the Gaussian Processes also produces an estimate of the error and we can use this too

- We can plot these alongside the marginal plots to give an idea of places where the emulator is performing poorly

## 1D marginal error plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
emulator <- readRDS(file = "../simulator/elbowFlow2d/emulator_run.rds")
x1_new <- 0.5
x2_new <- 0.5
x3_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
X_new <- matrix(NA, nrow = 100, ncol = 3)
X_new[, 1] <- x1_new
X_new[, 2] <- x2_new
X_new[, 3] <- x3_new

# Now create predictions everywhere
pred <- predict(emulator, X_new)

# Create a new data frame for plotting
df_new <- data.frame(
  largeInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 1],
  smallInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 2],
  kinematicViscosity = X_new[, 3] * (1e-5 - 1e-3) + 1e-3,
  yhat = pred$Y_hat,
  ylow = pred$Y_hat - 1.96 * sqrt(pred$MSE),
  yhigh = pred$Y_hat + 1.96 * sqrt(pred$MSE)
)
ggplot(df_new, aes(x = kinematicViscosity, y = yhat)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Large inlet and Small inlet velocities fixed at 0.5") +
  geom_line(aes(y = ylow), linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line(aes(y = yhigh), linetype = "dotted")
```

## 2D marginal error plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Next try varying two parameters and fixing the other
x1_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
x3_new <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)
x_new <- expand.grid(x1_new, x3_new)
# Now vary temperature left across this field
X_new <- matrix(NA,
  nrow = nrow(x_new),
  ncol = 3
)
# Replace the first column with the varying variable
X_new[, 1] <- x_new[, 1]
X_new[, 2] <- 0.5
X_new[, 3] <- x_new[, 2]

# Now create predictions everywhere
pred <- predict(emulator, X_new)

# Create a new data frame for plotting
df_new <- data.frame(
  largeInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 1],
  smallInletVelocityMagnitude = X_new[, 2],
  kinematicViscosity = X_new[, 3] * (1e-5 - 1e-3) + 1e-3,
  RMSE = sqrt(pred$MSE)
)

ggplot(df_new, aes(x = largeInletVelocityMagnitude, y = kinematicViscosity, z = RMSE)) +
  geom_contour_filled() +
  labs(fill = "RMSE") +
  ggtitle("Small inlet velocity fixed at 0.5")
```

## Cross validation

- An even better way of judging whether the emulator is working is to use __Cross Validation (CV)__

- This works by removing some of the data that the model was trained on, re-fitting the emulator, and predicting for the left out observations

- If the emulator can predict the left out observations well then it is doing a good job

- We usually plot the predictions from the left out data against the true observations. If they follow an identity relationship then the emulator is working well

## Leave one out CV code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
loo_fit <- rep(NA, n_runs)
for (i in 1:n_runs) {
  print(i)
  # Fit an emulator with one point missing
  curr_emulator <- GP_fit(
    initial_grid[-i, ],
    df_grid$out[-i]
  )
  # Get the prediction for the missing point
  loo_fit[i] <- predict(
    curr_emulator,
    initial_grid[i, , drop = FALSE]
  )$Y_hat
}
```

## Leave one out CV results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
loo_fit <- readRDS(file = "../simulator/elbowFlow2d/loo_fits.rds")
df_grid <- readRDS(file = "../simulator/elbowFlow2d/simulator_run.rds")
qplot(loo_fit, df_grid$out, geom = "point") +
  geom_abline() +
  xlab("LOO-CV fitted value") +
  ylab("True value")
```

## Calibrating the emulator with real-world observations

- Sometimes in addition to the emulator values we also have real-world observations on the process. We thus want to check whether the real world data match the emulator and whether there are systematic biases

- The usual equation people fit is:

$$\tilde{y}(X) = m(X) + \delta(X) + \epsilon$$

- Where $X$ are our inputs and $\tilde{y}$ our real world observations (*not* our simulator output)
- $m$ is the emulator (already fitted)
- $\delta(x)$ is another GP representing systematic bias
- $\epsilon$ is a pure noise error term representing observation error

- You will need to take another module (on Bayesian Modelling) to fit these kind of models!

## Summary

- We can create marginal 1D and 2D plots to check how well our emulator fits

- We can also run cross-validation to check out of sample performance

- Next (and finally): deploying the emulator and making it useful
