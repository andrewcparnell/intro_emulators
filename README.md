# Introduction to Emulation

Welcome to a very short course that covers introductory emulation using R. 

To get started make sure you have downloaded [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Then, open up Rstudio and in the Console window type:
`install.packages(c('GPfit', 'ggplot2'))`

To be able to run the larger example, you will need to download and install [docker](https://www.docker.com). If on Windows you might need to install [these additional steps](https://blog.jayway.com/2017/04/19/running-docker-on-bash-on-windows/).

If all works well, you are now ready to start the course. Download all the files for the course by clicking [here](https://github.com/andrewcparnell/intro_emulators/archive/master.zip). Unzip this file and then double click on the `intro_emulators.Rproj` file. You can now start coding!

All the slides for the course are available in pdf format in the `slides` folder. The videos associated with the slides are shown below, and the code in the `code` folder.

 5. Deploying the emulator and extensions | [code](https://andrewcparnell.github.io/Rfternoon/2_learn_mlr.R) | [stream video](https://media.heanet.ie/page/54f0439f6e7644bd99c1c4ac82cee758) | [download video](https://media.heanet.ie/download/54f0439f6e7644bd99c1c4ac82cee758) 

You should watch the videos above first and then try to follow the code by downloading the software and running it yourself whilst watching the videos.

(An older version of this course contained a much short introduction to emulation. The video associated with those slides is [here](https://media.heanet.ie/download/896172607cea4cdaa9001dc3260be3dd).)
